# EEG_to_Speech

Neural network models relating and/or classifying EEG to speech. These scripts are the product of my work during my Master thesis/internship at KU Leuven ESAT PSI Speech group. 

The code details the models' architecture and the steps taken in preparing the data for training and evaluating the models.

Three experiments were run, all details are explained in the pdf of the internship report.

Due to privacy and copyrights issues, the dataset used in the experiments cannot be shared.
